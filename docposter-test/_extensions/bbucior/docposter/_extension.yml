      # Also tried to set up the post-render hook here, following an example from
      # https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/6286#discussioncomment-6502919
      # but couldn't get it to recognize the render step (or raise an error for a "fake.R" step).
      # Instead, the post-render PDF configuration is now defined under as a
      # _quarto.yml project config.

      # Now, use the built-in support for authors + affiliations
      # (https://quarto.org/docs/journals/authors.html)
      # and custom includes (https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics)
